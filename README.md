## Project Setup

This project uses the "JCalendar_1.4" library. Follow these steps to include it in your IDE:

2. Open your IDE and navigate to the project settings or dependencies.

3. Add the "JCalendar_1.4.jar" file to the project's classpath or libraries.

4. Save the changes and rebuild the project.

Now, the project should recognize and use the "JCalendar_1.4" library.

**Note:** If the "JCalendar_1.4.jar" file is not in the project folder, you can download it from [here](https://example.com/path/to/JCalendar_1.4.jar) and place it in the `lib` or `libs` directory of your project.
